### How it works
Hi person who isn't us. If you're reading this section it means you either stumbled onto here, or one of us shared it with you. Here's how it works.

1) Click "Pick For Me"

2) Get your result.

3) Find your nearest one.

4) Eat there.


Not happy with your result? Click the button again to generate it afresh.

#### Acknowledgements
Yes, halfway through writing the list, I decided to inject my own flair into it. At least, if you've don't know us in real life, you can get the gist of what the restaurants are.

We hope you enjoy this!
